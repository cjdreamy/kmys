<center>At KMYS (Knowledge, Mind, Youth, Soul Community), we value research as a powerful tool to drive mental health
awareness, intervention, and policy change. However, we recognize that research involving human subjects-especially
young people and vulnerable communities-must be conducted with the highest ethical standards.</center>
